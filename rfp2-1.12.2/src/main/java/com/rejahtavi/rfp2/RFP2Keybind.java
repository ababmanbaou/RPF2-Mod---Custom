 * This helper class implements basic key bindings and state tracking of each key
 * Notes:
 *      Each key binding will spawn its own instance of this class
 *      Each instance will track the last known state of the binding, and watch for "rising edges" to trigger on
 *      This prevents annoying "multi-triggers" if the button is held down for more than one frame
